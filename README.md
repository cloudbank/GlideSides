Glide has a recyclerview preloader integrated as an extension.  I am adding capabilities like duplicate image detection and tensorflow lite image classification at preload, to be used in conjunction with the Android Paging library. I am currently building it inside of my [Edo](https://github.com/cloudbank/edo) application.
